This repository contains the full simulation code, visualizations, research presentation, and academic research paper titled EigenLayer’s Restaking Model: Expanding Capital Efficiency or Undermining Ethereum’s Security? by Benjamin Erickson.

The project explores the risks and rewards of EigenLayer’s restaking model through a custom Monte Carlo simulation of 1,000 Ethereum validators under various AVS failure scenarios. It quantifies validator earnings, slashing probabilities, and systemic risk while proposing original safeguard mechanisms.
